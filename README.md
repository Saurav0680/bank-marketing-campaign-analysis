# Bank Marketing Campaign Analysis

## Project Objective
The objective of this project is to analyze a bank marketing dataset and predict whether a customer will subscribe to a term deposit using machine learning models.

## Project Description
This project performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) and predictive modeling on a bank marketing dataset. 
Different machine learning algorithms are used to compare performance and accuracy.

## Dataset
- Bank Marketing Dataset
- Contains customer details, campaign information, and subscription status

## Steps Performed
1. Data loading and preprocessing
2. Handling missing values and duplicates
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
4. Feature encoding and scaling
5. Train-test split
6. Model training and evaluation

## Machine Learning Models Used
- Logistic Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)

## Evaluation Metric
- Accuracy Score

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## Result
Among the implemented models, SVM achieved the highest accuracy compared to Logistic Regression and KNN.

## Conclusion
Machine learning models can effectively predict customer subscription behavior and help banks improve marketing strategies.
